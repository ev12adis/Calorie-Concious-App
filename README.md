# Calorie Concious

The Calorie Conscious App is a full-stack web application designed to help users make informed choices when eating out. It considers a user's target daily caloric intake and food preferences to provide restaurant recommendations. This project aims to address the common challenge of underestimating the calorie content of various food items, helping users maintain a balanced diet while enjoying dining out.





## Project Motivation
Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is the widespread lack of awareness regarding the high-calorie content of some restaurant dishes. For instance, a seemingly innocent appetizer like Chipotle's Chips and Guacamole contains a surprising 720 calories, which can exceed the calorie count of a Big Mac from McDonald's (540 calories). This project aims to cater to individuals who appreciate dining out while also being conscious of their health.

One significant need for this application arises from the fact that eating out is often the most affordable meal option for low-income households. However, determining the most calorie-optimal meal can be challenging. The Calorie Conscious App fills this knowledge gap by suggesting meal options based on user preferences and daily calorie intake targets.
